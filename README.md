# Viberator 9000

## Motivation

I hate the idea of vibe coding so much that I'd rather let the machine vibe away than vibe code myself.

Viberator 9000 was inspired by [Windows 11 Agenda view being a web component](https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/12/07/windows-11s-agenda-view-in-the-notification-center-is-a-webview2-web-app-component-not-native/) instead of a native solution. It is intended to be a fully-blown GUI app that uses an LLM backend to respond to user inputs (ie. mouse movement or keystrokes), including rendering everything. Like it or not, at some point some idiot will decide that it's a valid approach to writing apps - but before the doom comes, let's have a laugh.

## Disclaimer

This project was hallucinated entirely organically, without any AI assistance. I even insisted on not using AI search functions in DuckDuckGo or other search engines.
